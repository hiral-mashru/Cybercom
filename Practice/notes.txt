name and id atributes are should be same and unique.

'for'atribute in label is used for saying that it's only for this input. And it's 
also used for bootstrap for proper alignment

we can used id in option tag but we should not do it bcz in select tag we can id 
there.

we can't get textarea's input directly like other inputs.

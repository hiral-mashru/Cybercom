Today I downloaded the git and and created account. Then I created repository and performed today's   
task like generating the SSH key and how to clone the repo in local machine and also   
how upload our project into the github without using git clone. I did practice   
of how to make branches and how to upload folders and files into different branch and how to   
switch the branch. Also learned how to pull and push the changes. And also how to merge   
the branches. Also got to know what the use of SSH key and difference between SSH and deploy   
key and difference between fork and clone.

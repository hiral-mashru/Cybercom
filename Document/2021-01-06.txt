Today, I did practice of pull the request and push the request, what if we skip staging area then what command we should use,     
difference between staging-unstaging area, observe the git status at every step,the difference between fetch and pull request when to use them,     
difference between CVCS and DVCS, what is SVN, difference between tracked and untracked files, commands performed on git branches, git rebase.  
Also checked different cases like if we create the directory and push it to github and then delete from system then how to recover that directory, etc...
